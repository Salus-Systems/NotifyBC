The administrator API provides knowledge factor based authentication mechanism to identify admin request, as opposed to possession factor based admin ip list. Because knowledge factor based authentication is vulnerable to brute-force attack, administrator API is less favourable than admin ip list. Administrator API should only be used in rare circumstances such as when obtaining the client's ip or ip range is infeasible.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Example Use Case</h5>
  <p>Administrator API was created to address an OpenShift limitation - the ip of a request initiated from an OpenShift pod cannot be restricted to the pod's project. Instead the ip is shared by all OpenShift projects. Therefore it's difficult to impose granular access control based on client ip.</p>
</div>


To enable knowledge factor based authentication, a super-admin manually calls *POST /administrators* API to create an admin user. Next, the super-admin calls *POST /administrators/login* API to login the admin user. If both calls are successful, the *POST /administrators/login* API returns an access token. The super-admin gives the access token to the client, who can make authenticated requests by supplying the access token in either *Authorization* HTTP header or *access_token* query parameter. 

More details on creating access token can be found [here](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Introduction-to-User-model-authentication.html). All occurrence of */Users* in the referenced doc should be interpreted as */administrators*, which is *NotifyBC*'s user model name.

<div class="note">
  <h5>ProTipsâ„¢ Adjust TTL</h5>
  <p>By default TTL of an access token is set to 14 days by LoopBack. The default time is based on the assumption that a user can login themselves. But <i>NotifyBC</i> only allows super-admin to access Administrator API. You may want to bump up TTL significantly to reduce administrative overhead.</p>
