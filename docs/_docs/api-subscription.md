The subscription API encapsulates the backend workflow of user subscription and un-subscription of push notification service. Depending on whether a API call comes from user browser as a user request or from an authorized server as an admin request, NotifyBC applies different validation rules. For user requests, the notification channel entered by user is unconfirmed. A confirmation code will be associated with this request. The confirmation code  can be created in one of two ways:

 * by NotifyBC based on a RegEx pattern specified in the request.
 * by a trusted third party. This trusted third party encrypts the confirmation code using the public RSA key of the NotifyBC instance (see more about [RSA Key Config](../configuration/#rsa-keys)) and pass the encrypted confirmation code to NotifyBC via user browser in the same subscription request. NotifyBC then decrypts to obtain the confirmation code. This method allows user subscribe to multiple notification services provided by NotifyBC instances in different trust domains and only have to confirm the subscription channel once during one browser session. In such case only one NotifyBC instance should be chosen to deliver confirmation request to user.
 
Equipped with the confirmation code and a message template, NotifyBC can now send out confirmation request to unconfirmed subscription channel. At a minimum this confirmation request should contain the confirmation code. When user receives the message, he/she echos the confirmation code back to a NotifyBC provided API to verify against saved record. If match, the state of the subscription request is changed to confirmed.

For admin requests, NotifyBC can still perform the above confirmation process. But admin request has full CRUD privilege, including set the subscription state to confirmed, therefore skipping confirmation. 

The workflow of user subscribing to notification services offered by a single service provider is illustrated by sequence diagram below. In this case, the confirmation code is generated by NotifyBC.

In the case user subscribing to notifications offered by different service providers in separate trust domains, the confirmation code is generated by a third-party server app trusted by all NotifyBC instances. Following sequence diagram shows the workflow. The diagram indicates *NotifyBC API Server 2* is chosen to send confirmation request.

## Get Subscriptions
```
GET /subscriptions
```
* inputs 
  * a filter defining fields, where, include, order, offset, and limit
    * parameter name: filter
    * required: false
    * parameter type: query
    * data type: object
* outcome
  * for admin requests, returns unabridged array of subscription data matching the filter
  * for user requests, in addition to filter, following constraints are imposed on the returned array
    * only non-deleted subscriptions 
    * only subscriptions created by the user 
    * the *confirmationRequest* field is removed. 

## Create a Subscription
```
POST /subscriptions
```
* inputs
  * an object containing subscription data model fields. At a minimum all required fields that don't have a default value must be supplied. Id field should be omitted since it's auto-generated.
    * parameter name: data
    * required: true
    * parameter type: body
    * data type: object
* outcome

  NotifyBC performs following actions in sequence
  
  1. inputs are validated. If validation fails, error is returned.
  2. for user requests, the *state* field is forced to *unconfirmed*
  3. for authenticated user request, *userId* field is populated with authenticated userId.
  4. if *confirmationRequest.confirmationCodeEncrypted* is populated, a confirmation code is generated by decrypting this field using private RSA key, then put decrypted confirmation code to field *confirmationRequest.confirmationCode*
  5. otherwise, for user requests and for admin requests missing message template, the message template is set to configured value. Then, if *confirmationRequest.confirmationCodeRegex* is populated, a confirmation code is generated conforming to regex and put to field *confirmationRequest.confirmationCode*
  6. the subscription request is saved to database.
  7. if *confirmationRequest.sendRequest* is true, a confirmation request is sent to *userChannelId* using the template fields in *confirmationRequest* after performing [mail merge](../overview/#mail-merge).
  8. The subscription data, including auto-generated id, is returned as response unless there is error when sending confirmation request or saving to database. For user request, the field *confirmationRequest* is removed prior to sending the response.
  
* examples
  1. To subscribe a user to service *education*, copy and paste following json object to the data value box in API explorer, change email addresses as needed, and click *Try it out!* button:
  ```
  {
    "serviceName": "education",
    "channel": "email",
    "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com"
  }
  ```
        
     As a result, *foo@bar.com* should receive an email confirmation request, and following json object is returned to caller upon sending the email successfully for admin request:
    ```json
      {
        "serviceName": "education",
        "channel": "email",
        "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
        "state": "unconfirmed",
        "confirmationRequest": {
          "confirmationCodeRegex": "\\d{5}",
          "sendRequest": true,
          "from": "no_reply@bar.com",
          "subject": "confirmation",
          "textBody": "Enter {confirmation_code} on screen",
          "confirmationCode": "45304"
        },
        "created": "2016-10-03T17:35:40.202Z",
        "updated": "2016-10-03T17:35:40.202Z",
        "id": "57f296ec7eead50554c61de7"
      }
    ```

      For non-admin request, the field *confirmationRequest* is removed from response, and field *userId* is populated from SiteMinder header if request is authenticated:
    ```json
      {
        "serviceName": "education",
        "channel": "email",
        "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
        "state": "unconfirmed",
        "userId": "<user_id>",
        "created": "2016-10-03T18:17:09.778Z",
        "updated": "2016-10-03T18:17:09.778Z",
        "id": "57f2a0a5b1aa0e2d5009eced"
      }
    ```
  2. To subscribe a user to service *education* with RSA public key encrypted confirmation code supplied, POST following request 
  
      ```json
      {
        "serviceName": "education",
        "channel": "email",
        "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
        "confirmationRequest": {
         "confirmationCodeEncrypted": "<encrypted-confirmation-code>",
         "sendRequest": true,
         "from": "no_reply@bar.com",
         "subject": "confirmation",
         "textBody": "Enter {confirmation_code} on screen"
        }
      }
      ```
      
      As a result, *NotifyBC* will decrypt the confirmation code using the private RSA key, replace placeholder  *{confirmation_code}* in the email template with the confirmation code, and send confirmation request to *foo@bar.com*.
  
## Verify a Confirmation Code
```
GET /subscriptions/{id}/verify
```
* inputs
  * subscription id
    * parameter name: id
    * required: true
    * parameter type: path
    * data type: string
  * confirmation code
    * parameter name: confirmationCode
    * required: true
    * parameter type: query
    * data type: string
* outcome

  NotifyBC performs following actions in sequence
  
  1. the subscription identified by *id* is retrieved
  2. for user request, the *userId* of the subscription is checked against current request user, if not match, error is returned; otherwise
  3. input parameter *confirmationCode* is checked against *confirmationRequest.confirmationCode*. If not match, error is returned; otherwise
  4. *state* is set to *confirmed*
  5. the subscription is saved back to database
  6. returns HTTP status code 200 for success unless error occurs during saving
      
## Update a Subscription
```
PATCH /subscriptions/{id}
```
This API is used for changing user channel id (such as email address) and resending confirmation code. 

* inputs
  * subscription id
    * parameter name: id
    * required: true
    * parameter type: path
    * data type: string
  * an object containing fields to be updated. 
    * parameter name: data
    * required: true
    * parameter type: body
    * data type: object

* outcome

  NotifyBC processes the request similarly as creating a subscription except during input validation it imposes following extra constraints to user request  
  * only fields *userChannelId*, *state* and *confirmationRequest* can be updated     
  * when changing *userChannelId*, *confirmationRequest* must also be supplied
  * if *userChannelId* is different from the saved record, *state* is forced to *unconfirmed*.

     
## Delete a Subscription (unsubscribing)
```
DELETE /subscriptions/{id}
or 
GET /subscriptions/{id}/unsubscribe
```
* inputs
  * subscription id
    * parameter name: id
    * required: true
    * parameter type: path
    * data type: string
  * unsubscription code for anonymous request 
    * parameter name: unsubscriptionCode
    * required: false
    * parameter type: query
    * data type: string
* outcome

  NotifyBC performs following actions in sequence
  
  1. the subscription identified by *id* is retrieved
  2. for user request, 
    * if request is authenticated, the *userId* of the subscription is checked against current request user, if not match, request is rejected
    * if request is anonymous, and server is configured to require unsubscription code, the input  unsubscription code is matched againts the *unsubscriptionCode* field. Request is rejected if not match 
    * if the subscription state is not *confirmed*, request is rejected
  3. the field *state* is set to *deleted*
  4. the subscription is saved back to database
  5. for anonymous unsubscription, an acknowledgement notification is sent to user if configured so 
  6. returns 
    * for anonymous request, either the message or redirect as configured in *anonymousUnsubscription.acknowledgements.onScreen*
    * for authenticated user or admin requests, number of records affected or error message if occurred.
* <a name="unsubscription-example"></a> example 

  To allow an anonymous subscriber to unsubscribe, provide following link in notification messages

  ```
  {http_host}{restApiRoot}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/unsubscribe?unsubscriptionCode={unsubscriptionCode}
  ```    
  All placeholders enclosed in {} will be replaced dynamically when sending notification.
     
## Un-deleteing a Subscription
```
GET /subscriptions/{id}/unsubscribe/undo
```
This API allows an anonymous subscriber to undo an unauthorized unsubscription.

* inputs
  * subscription id
    * parameter name: id
    * required: true
    * parameter type: path
    * data type: string
  * unsubscription code 
    * parameter name: unsubscriptionCode
    * required: false
    * parameter type: query
    * data type: string
* outcome

  NotifyBC performs following actions in sequence
  
  1. the subscription identified by *id* is retrieved
  2. for user request, 
    * if request is anonymous, and server is configured to require unsubscription code, the input  unsubscription code is matched againts the *unsubscriptionCode* field. Request is rejected if not match 
    * if request is authenticated, request is rejected
    * if the subscription state is not *deleted*, request is rejected
  3. the field *state* is set to *confirmed*
  4. the subscription is saved back to database
  5. returns either the message or redirect as configured in *[anonymousUndoUnsubscription](../configuration/#anonymousUndoUnsubscription)*

  To allow an anonymous subscriber to undo unsubscription, provide following link in unsubscription acknowledgement notification, which is by default set

  ```
  {http_host}{restApiRoot}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/unsubscribe/undo?unsubscriptionCode={unsubscriptionCode}
  ```    
  All placeholders enclosed in {} will be replaced dynamically when sending notification.
